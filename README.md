# Gamer Spot

A more detailed README is on its way. For now, to run the app locally, start the posgres service with `sudo service postgresql start`, run `rails s` to start the server, and run `npm start --prefix client` to open the app in the browser. Additionally, the app is deployed [here](https://gamer-spot.herokuapp.com/), but it tends to be a few commits behind.
